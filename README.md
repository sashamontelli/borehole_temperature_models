# Englacial borehole temperature model

Code to solve the one-dimensional englacial temperature evolution model (both inversion and forward sensitivity simulations) presented in the article *Geothermal heat flux is the dominant source of uncertainty in englacial-temperature-based dating of ice-rise formation* by Montelli and Kingslake in The Cryosphere. 

The python code needed to run the model is included. Some of the figures presented in the paper were further tidied up; the resulting rasters are provided in the directory *figures*.

All code runs in Python 3.9 and usually would require some modules to be installed before they can be imported.

### Downloading and running the code

The easiest way to run this code is via Jupyter Notebook.
